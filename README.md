<h1 align="center"> STATIC WEBPAGE </h1>

This project is a simple front-end development of a webpage. This is my first project. The webpage was designed for the e-commerce purpose of a brand. Every brand should have their own site for their marketing growth and that is my motive to develope this project. Since it is my first project I have faced some challenges and difficulties while developing the webpage and I rectified all the things by trying again and again. I solved all the problems before uploading the project in GitHub. Now the webpage was works fine and there is no issues or bugs and also I tested my webpage properly.

### WHY I DEVELOPED THIS PROJECT:

As a beginner in development I want to develope some projects. Simply learning is not enough to become a good developer. Learning by doing is the best practice. So I developed this simple webpage. Making projects will definitely implement my skills and make me better in real-time environment.

### FEATURES:

- The webpage contains some menu options
- It also contains form links such as login and contact
- The webpage was very responsive and attractive too
- The buttons and menu options in the webpage are designed beautifully with hover effects

### BUILD STATUS:
Now I have developed only the home page. Later in future all the menus and forms will be developed seperately and linked together. I am also able to develope according to the user's need too.

### LANGUAGES USED:

- I have used HTML for the structure of the webpage
- And CSS for the styling of the webpage
